# The-Green-Mile
The Green Mile is a company which specializes in door to door delivery of packages. As cities get more and more congested, Green Mile has set up logistical hubs at the edge of the city, where suppliers can deliver their packages. Green Mile will bundle these packages from different suppliers based on delivery conditions, then use electric vehicles to enter the city and deliver the packages in the most efficient way.
